				For example, a database that stores a table of players and a table of bowling games.
				Any sport would work, I think bowling might be easy because of its simplicity:
				  - No overtime/ extra innings
				  - Could be stored as: each player has its own row for each game and
				      multiplayer matches just need to store a match id, the player ids, the date, and maybe the winner.
				The application would need to be able to add, modify, remove, and display data from the tables.""";
