### Application (Idea from Ian D): 

A build your own pizza application which will:
* Let the user choose the pizza's size, toppings, sauce, and the crust.
* Then it calculates the total cost for the created pizza (and displays it back to the user).
* The application will be able to show the total cost of pizzas that one customer ordered
* In the DB one table will store the available pizza options and their prices
* Another table will store the list of ordered pizzas
* One final table will store the list of customers
